# CometCodeExam
Traffic Control simulator

Coding Exam for my application to join the Comet Backup Team in Christchurch!

Currently this is as far as I got in the timeframe. I would of course like to do more but this is where I am at.

I have identified the problem and built basic functionality to get the numbers working. 

Further Development would involve adding an input to the html interface so that values can be changed in the browser by the user.
## 5 hours more coding to achieve most recent commit with input fields that update the Score UI.

I didn't have time to implement the Extensions but I will use this as a study tool to further my development and it is an 
interesting assignment in which I have personal interest in. It sounds funny but I like the idea of making road intersections better
with programming. I see it every day and I love the idea it can be made better with observation and good programming.

To run this, copy the files to a local directory , then drag and drop the index.html file into a browser. Open the developer tools 
to see the console for feedback from the code as well.

To adjust the road CPM (cars per minute) value, open script.js and change the first 4 variables as you like.

Thanks so much for the opportunity! This is my first code exam from a job application so its been a blast!
